1.What is View? What are the benefits of using views?
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. Complex and reusable queries can be simply retrived using view.

2.Can data be modified through views?
 Yes. data can be modified using views but it is not recommended when view using more than one base table.

3.	What is stored procedure and what are the benefits of using it?
Store procedure is a collection of DML,DDL statements that can be executed together. Store procedures are helpful in maintaining clean scripts and easy testable and isolates business rules etc.

4.	What is the difference between view and stored procedure?
View has just select statements but storeprocedure has collection of DML and DDL statements.

5.	What is the difference between stored procedure and functions?
 Store procedure can return any number of values or may not return any value but function must return a value.We can use transaction in SP but it is not possible in functions. We can have both input and output paramenters in sp but we can have only input parameters in function.

6.	Can stored procedure return multiple result sets?
 Yes

7.	Can stored procedure be executed as part of SELECT Statement? Why?
No. Because store proc may or may not retun a value.

8.	What is Trigger? What types of Triggers are there?
 Trigger in sql server is used for business logics to be executed. SQl server has after trigger and insead of trigger for insert,update and delete statements

9.	What are the scenarios to use Triggers?
We can prevent creation of duplicate records. To create logs and so on.

10.	What is the difference between Trigger and Stored Procedure?
 Triggers happen on DML statements occurence where as store procs should be excuted manually.
